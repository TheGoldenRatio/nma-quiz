It may be tempting to focus on specific, immediate ideas but the Jobs to be Done framework gets us to take a step back and think about the fundamental tasks customers are trying to get done in their lives. When people buy ice cream, what Jobs are they looking to fulfill beyond enjoying something tasty? The next few questions will guide us through the Jobs Atlas."

These are just a couple functional jobs that ice cream can satisfy. Eating ice cream after a tough day is more of an emotional job than a functional job. And sprinkles, sweetness, and coldness are product features rather than jobs. Remember, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to avoid solutions and features.
