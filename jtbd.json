It may be tempting to jump to specific ideas but the Jobs to Be Done framework asks us to take a step back and think about the fundamental tasks customers are try to get done in their lives. When people buy ice cream, is it really about flavors or price? The next few questions will guide us through the Jobs framework."

Getting ice cream is also a great way to extend a date that's going well or hang out longer with a friend to finish that engaging conversation. Those are just a couple functional jobs that ice cream can satisfy. Eating ice cream after a tough day is more of an emotional, rather than functional job. And sprinkles, sweetness, and coldness are product features rather than jobs. Remember that we're trying to avoid solutions and features and focusing on the needs of the customer first."
